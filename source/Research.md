**2 IND ELEVATORS OPEN TO FREE USE** New York Times, September 6th, 1957.

https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/09/06/93216229.html?pageNumber=19

Elevators at 181st St and 190th St on the A were originally inside fare control, so they would have had two booths each at the top of the elevators on Ft Washington Ave and the end of the long passageways to Overlook Terrace / Bennett Ave. Currently, the control areas at the bottom of the elevators both carry an "A" suffix - N7A at 181st St, N6A at 190th St. There are also two unused booth codes adjacent to these - N5 (Dyckman St is N3 & N4) and N8 (N9 is the south mezzanine of 181st St). My conclusion then is that before the elevators were made free, the top and bottom booths were N5/N6 at 190th St and N7/N8 at 181st St.

There's not really any way to know which was which, so I'm going to choose bottom/top as the order for both.
* N5 - 190th St - Lower Mez at Bennett Ave & W 193rd St
* N6 - 190th St - Upper Mez at Fort Washington Ave & Cabrini Blvd
* N7 - 181st St - Lower Mez at Overlook Terrace & W 184th St
* N8 - 181st St - Upper Mez at Fort Washington Ave & W 184th St

The article was published 9/6/57 and says the "ceremonial ribbons ... were cut yesterday morning" putting the change on 9/5/57.

**BOTANIC GARDEN STATION OPENED** Brooklyn Daily Eagle, October 1st, 1928.

This notice about the opening of the Botanic Garden station mentions an exit at President St that hadn't been completed yet. If that entrance did open, it closed at some point, possibly when the platforms were shortened during the 1998-1999 reconstruction (citation: https://web.archive.org/web/20200706141421/http://subwaynut.com/ct/botanic_gardens/index.php). There is an unused booth code, B11 - B10 is the northern mezzanine at this station, while B12 is the northern mezzanine at the next station (Prospect Park), so it would make sense for B11 to be a *southern* mezzanine at Botanic Garden. I'm assuming that it was used by or reserved for the President St entrance mentioned in the Daily Eagle notice.

**MetroTech FEIS** has a series of station diagrams which, while not labeled with booth codes, show that there was an additional token booth at Borough Hall, located on the north side of Fulton St opposite R604. Given that R602 is also a control area at Borough Hall, and R603 is not otherwise assigned to anything, I'm assuming that **R603** was the code for this booth.

**Orchard Beach** are a set of turnstiles that provide access to the *bus* - and they are outfitted with OMNY, per the photos in this tweet: https://twitter.com/cynthia4nyc/status/1694824539002212728/photo/1

**Control Areas with Multiple Exits**

**Atlantic Av-Barclays Center (B1)** is a booth that showed up in the turnstile data once, and would logically correspond to the northern BMT mezz connected to the Williamsburg Savings Bank. That control area is now tracked as part of R610.

**Spring St (N87)** the S/B platform has two separate exits, one at Spring St and one at Vandam St. The Vandam St exit is different from the long-closed exits to Spring St at Charlton/Prince Sts; I can't find any specific records but am going to call the Vandam St exit **N87A**.

**Fulton St (R205A)** is the code used for both the N/B and S/B exits at Cortlandt St of the 4/5 platforms. R206 and R208 are the control areas on the S/B platform at Fulton and Dey St; R205 was an entrance to the N/B platform at Dey St prior to the construction of the Fulton Transit Center. This suggests that R205A is specifically the *S/B* entrance at Cortlandt St, and the N/B entrance is R206A.

**1 Av (H7A)** is the code used for the new Avenue A entrances opened in 2019; there's no mezzanine though, just two separate entraces on each platform. At 1 Av, H7 is the N/B entrance while H8 is the S/B entrance, so I'm assuming that H8A is the S/B entrance at Avenue A, and is just tracked under H7A.

**4 Av - 9 St (C12)** only one code is used to track the entraces to the R platforms at 9 St, but there are two separate entraces on each platform. **C13** is otherwise unassigned, so it likely is one of these entrances. The adjacent R stations (Union St, Prospect Av, and 25 St) are numbered with the N/B entrance first, so assuming 9 St fits that pattern C12 would be the N/B entrance and C13 would be the S/B entrance.

North of Dyckman St, the stations on the 1 train don't have booths on the N/B platforms, and haven't likely since the 80s if not earlier. All of these stations are tracked with a single booth code despite not having connected mezzanines, *and* there are regular gaps in the numbering:
* **R188** is 207 St (nothing is **R187**)
* **R190** is 215 St (nothing is **R189**)
* **R192** is Marble Hill-225 St (nothing is **R191**)
* **R194** is 231 St (nothing is **R193**)
* **R196** is 238 St (nothing is **R195**)
Given **R186** is in use at Dyckman St and **R197** is in use at Van Cortlandt Park, we can infer that the currently in use even numbered codes at the stations in between are the S/B entrances, and the missing odd numbered codes are for the unstaffed N/B entrances.

**68 St - Hunter College** has two new entrances currently under construction; N/B opened in March 2023, S/B is planned for early 2024. Unclear from the published plans what these will be designated so I'm going to guess at R246A and R246B in order of opening.

**South Ferry** the new South Ferry station opened in 2009, with two additional entrances north of the ferry terminal. In May 2012, until the station was closed due to Hurricane Sandy, turnstile tracking was reassigned from R101 (the booth adjacent to the ferry terminal) to R101S. I'm guessing that R101S is the southern of the two new entrances at Water St, so the one further north at Pearl St would be R101N.
