# MTA Lookup Files
The MTA publishes a huge amount of open data, from turnstile counts to train statuses and bus locations. However, not all of the metadata associated with those feeds is updated and much of it is not easily joinable. This is my attempt to rationalize some of the metadata for these data sets.

The *source* folder includes copies of the original files published by the MTA; noted below are the original paths and retrieval dates. The *clean* folder includes my rationalized versions of those files and mappling files that can be used to join across them.

## Cleaned Files

**remote_booth_station.csv**: this is a rationalized Remote-Booth-Station file with the following improvements over the MTA's currently posted copy:
* Includes stations that have opened since 2015 (Hudson Yards, 2nd Av Subway, WTC Cortlandt, plus new exits on the L and others)
* **status** current status for the booth; Open, Closed, or Vending-Only (several booths in the MTA lookup file are locations with MetroCard vending machines outside transit stations, like LGA, Eltingville Park, or the MetroCard Buses).
* **has_booth** flag for whether this control area still has a token booth (many were removed in 2010)
* **prior_remotes** / **prior_station_names** list of remote units and station names a booth had since ~2009

## Sources

**Remote-Booth-Station.xls**: lookup provided by the MTA as metadata for their turnstile data set. Maps Booths (aka C/As or Control Areas) to Remotes (stations or sections of stations) and station information like name, line, and division. Since 10/18/14 all these columns have been included in the turnstile data files themselves. Given the absence of certain stations and what names other stations have, I think this file was last updated in mid-2012; although it includes references to long-shuttered entrances dating at least to the 90s if not earlier.

**Remote-Booth-Station_Turnstile.csv**: booth information pulled from the MTA's weekly turnstile data. All metadata from 10/2014 onward is from the turnstile files themselves; prior to that I populated metadata using the official Remote-Booth-Station file. The code used to generate this file is in **turnstiles.py**.

**2009_nyct_booth_closures.pdf**: due to the 2008 global financial crisis, in January 2009 the MTA prepared a plan to cut costs by shuttering token booths and reducing the number of booth attendants. As part of the proposal, this document was prepared, which includes labeled blue prints of every station with impacted booths. The plan didn't end up being enacted until 2010, and some changes may have been made, but this document seems largely accurate - all kiosks were removed, and most stations had all but one booth closed.

**2009_nyct_booth_closures.csv**: my transcription of the booth details from the blueprints. Includes station name, lines, borough, and booth / control area designation, plus additionally:
* **Current** / **Proposed**: the control area's booth status, using MTA shorthand - F/T is a full-time booth, P/T is a part-time booth, K is a kiosk (booth with no sales, just customer service), X is an automated entry control area (no booth).
* **Description**: my shorthand for where the control area is located. Access to only one platform is indicated with NB or SB (north-bound or south-bound) while M means access to a Mezzanine; then I note the closest cross street; finally a cardinal direction if multiple control areas are at the same intersection.
* **Additional C/As**: some control areas that never had booths (often exit-only or single-HEET C/As) don't get their own code, so when codes are reused I list the secondary C/As here with the same notation as the Description column. Ex: Clinton-Washington Avs has four exits, but while the SB exits have different codes (N112 and N112A) the NB exits are both just coded N111; so N111's description is *NB Clinton Ave* with an additional C/A at *NB Washington Av*.
* **Notes**: any additional notes from the blueprints, about ongoing work or station changes.
