# MTA Lookup Files
The MTA publishes a huge amount of open data, from turnstile counts to train statuses and bus locations. However, not all of the metadata associated with those feeds is updated and much of it is not easily joinable. This is my attempt to rationalize some of the metadata for these data sets.
The *source* folder includes copies of the original files published by the MTA; noted below are the original paths and retrieval dates. The *clean* folder includes my rationalized versions of those files and mappling files that can be used to join across them.
