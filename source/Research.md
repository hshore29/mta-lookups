**2 IND ELEVATORS OPEN TO FREE USE** New York Times, September 6th, 1957.

https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/09/06/93216229.html?pageNumber=19

Elevators at 181st St and 190th St on the A were originally inside fare control, so they would have had two booths each at the top of the elevators on Ft Washington Ave and the end of the long passageways to Overlook Terrace / Bennett Ave. Currently, the control areas at the bottom of the elevators both carry an "A" suffix - N7A at 181st St, N6A at 190th St. There are also two unused booth codes adjacent to these - N5 (Dyckman St is N3 & N4) and N8 (N9 is the south mezzanine of 181st St). My conclusion then is that before the elevators were made free, the top and bottom booths were N5/N6 at 190th St and N7/N8 at 181st St.

There's not really any way to know which was which, so I'm going to choose bottom/top as the order for both.
* N5 - 190th St - Lower Mez at Bennett Ave & W 193rd St
* N6 - 190th St - Upper Mez at Fort Washington Ave & Cabrini Blvd
* N7 - 181st St - Lower Mez at Overlook Terrace & W 184th St
* N8 - 181st St - Upper Mez at Fort Washington Ave & W 184th St

The article was published 9/6/57 and says the "ceremonial ribbons ... were cut yesterday morning" putting the change on 9/5/57.

**BOTANIC GARDEN STATION OPENED** Brooklyn Daily Eagle, October 1st, 1928.

https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3562745/botanic-garden-station-opens-october/

This notice about the opening of the Botanic Garden station mentions an exit at President St that hadn't been completed yet. If that entrance did open, it closed at some point, possibly when the platforms were shortened during the 1998-1999 reconstruction (citation: https://web.archive.org/web/20200706141421/http://subwaynut.com/ct/botanic_gardens/index.php). There is an unused booth code, B11 - B10 is the northern mezzanine at this station, while B12 is the northern mezzanine at the next station (Prospect Park), so it would make sense for B11 to be a *southern* mezzanine at Botanic Garden. I'm assuming that it was used by or reserved for the President St entrance mentioned in the Daily Eagle notice.

**Atlantic Av-Barclays Center (B1)** is a booth that showed up in the turnstile data once, and would logically correspond to the northern BMT mezz connected to the Williamsburg Savings Bank. That control area is now tracked as part of R610.

**Spring St (N87)** has two separate exits, one at Spring St and one at Vandam St. The Vandam St exit is different from the long-closed exits to Spring St at Charlton/Prince Sts; I can't find any specific records but am going to call the Vandam St exit **N87A**.
